Practice using SQL to analyse/extract data from databases. (https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/7/#)
Not all the relevant files are committed here, just those most interesting.

## [Fiftyville](./fiftyville/README.md)
Databases including bank accounts, phone numbers, phone records etc, were provided, as were witness statements to a fake theft. 
log.sql contains the code used to join databases and search to find the culprit, their current location, and their accomplice.

## [Movies](./movies/README.md)
This task was as follows
In 11.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of the five highest rated movies (in order) that Chadwick Boseman starred in, starting with the highest rated.
Your query should output a table with a single column for the title of each movie.
You may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Chadwick Boseman.
In 12.sql, write a SQL query to list the titles of all movies in which both Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter starred.
Your query should output a table with a single column for the title of each movie.
You may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Johnny Depp.
You may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Helena Bonham Carter.
In 13.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie in which Kevin Bacon also starred.
Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.
There may be multiple people named Kevin Bacon in the database. Be sure to only select the Kevin Bacon born in 1958.
Kevin Bacon himself should not be included in the resulting list.
